Created an app where the user should be able to upload an image at any size, and have both the original size and a thumbnail size

## Run

- Upload a jpg to the lambda-lab17 lambda file and it will be resized and placed into the lambda-lab17-resize

- My collegues, TAs and I were not able to solve my bug. I am able to upload a photo but it does not show up in the resize file
